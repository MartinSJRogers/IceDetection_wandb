# IceDetection_wandb
Sea ice detection using CNN algorithm and hyperparamter tuning using weights and biases


This code uses a convolutional neural network to identify the dominant ice-water interface via Sentinel-1 SAR imagery. Dataset used to train the model not currently publicly available. Weights and biases (wandb) module used during hyperparameter tuning to identify best performing neural network. 

implemented in python using Tensorflow (Keras backend).
